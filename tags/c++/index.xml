      <description>Motrav (Mobile tracking vehicle) is a smart system that enhances your vehicle&amp;rsquo;s security and accessibility. The system consists of an electronic device, a cloud server, and a mobile app. This project is my final research project, where I designed a system that can be used to track vehicles, control vehicle engines, and provide warnings through the phone when vehicles are detected in &amp;ldquo;suspicious&amp;rdquo; conditions.
For this project i worked on the electrical board device, apps design, system integration and evaluation.</description>
